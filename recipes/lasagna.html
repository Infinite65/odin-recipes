    <h1>Chicken Parmesan in Cream Sauce</h1>
    <img src="Chicken">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is not your usual chicken Parmesan! Instead, chicken tenders are coated in a mixture of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and Italian-seasoned panko crumbs, fried to a golden brown, and finished in a lovely cream sauce. A side of pasta would be good with this, or try mashed potatoes. A green vegetable and a salad will complete this dinner menu, nicely!
    </p>
