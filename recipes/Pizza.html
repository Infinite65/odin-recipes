    <h1>Easy Tortilla Pizza</h1>
    <img src="pizza.webp">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is not your usual chicken Parmesan! Instead, chicken tenders are coated in a mixture of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and Italian-seasoned panko crumbs, fried to a golden brown, and finished in a lovely cream sauce. A side of pasta would be good with this, or try mashed potatoes. A green vegetable and a salad will complete this dinner menu, nicely!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place tortilla on a baking sheet. Brush with olive oil; sprinkle garlic powder, salt, and pepper on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and spread tomato sauce on top; arrange chicken breast, green bell pepper, and green onions over tomato sauce. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle oregano over cheese. Slice pizza into wedges using a pizza cutter.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat chicken tenders dry with paper towels and season lightly with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place flour on a shallow plate. Place beaten eggs into a shallow bowl. Combine grated Parmesan cheese, Italian-seasoned panko crumbs, and 1 teaspoon smoked paprika, and place on a second shallow plate.</li>
        <li>Cover a dinner plate or platter with parchment paper.</li>
